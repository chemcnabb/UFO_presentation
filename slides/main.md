<ol>
	<li>Money</li>
	<li>researchers are on the side</li>
	<li>UFO reports are numerous and only a handful of researchers can investigate on their own time</li>
	<li>most reports can be explained</li>
</ol>







<p>Hynek stated that &quot;if there wasnt a pattern there&#39;s be nothing to study&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>interesting.&nbsp; What could he mean?&nbsp; wouldnt want to reveal any profiling they have done since it would fuel hoaxers</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MUFON sighting report is interesting.&nbsp; There are descriptors</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7% of millions of sightings will take work to sift.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
